# Predictive-Maintenance

Goal of the Project:

The goal of this predictive maintenance project is to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict and prevent machine failures in a milling process. The project aims to utilize historical data from the milling process to create a predictive model that can identify signs of machine failure before it occurs.
